# Image Gallery

A simple image gallery app made as a code showcase

## Getting Started

The following instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need to add your own Flickr API Key in order to use the app. Fortunately, Flickr provides an easy way to get a disposable one. Just do the following:

```
* Open the Flickr Api Explorer - https://www.flickr.com/services/api/explore/flickr.photos.search
* Do a search (use the 'tags' field)
* Copy the key from the given url request string
* Replace the "API_KEY_HERE" tag in the code with your new generated key.
```

### How to use

The app is simple to use. Just search for a tag and the results will appear in a grid below the search bar. 

You can also click on any image to open it.
